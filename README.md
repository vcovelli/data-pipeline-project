## ETL Data Pipeline

This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built with **Prefect** for data orchestration. The pipeline extracts data, performs transformations, and loads the data into a destination database (e.g., Snowflake).

### Project Overview

This ETL pipeline demonstrates an end-to-end data workflow using Prefect, a modern workflow orchestration tool. The pipeline is designed to run both locally and in Prefect Cloud, making it easy to monitor, schedule, and manage.

### Pipeline Structure

The ETL pipeline consists of three main tasks:

1. **Extract Data**: Pulls data from a source (e.g., a simulated API response).
2. **Transform Data**: Modifies the data as needed. In this example, it doubles the `age` attribute for each record.
3. **Load Data**: Loads the transformed data into a destination (e.g., a database or data warehouse).

These tasks are orchestrated using Prefect, with the flow structure defined in `data_pipeline.py`.

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-pipeline-project.git
cd data-pipeline-project

#### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure to install Prefect and any other required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: If requirements.txt doesnâ€™t exist yet, add it with the necessary packages (e.g., prefect, snowflake-connector-python).

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables (if needed)
If your pipeline requires sensitive information (e.g., database credentials), store these in environment variables or Prefect Secrets.

For example:

export DB_USER="your_user"
export DB_PASSWORD="your_password"
export DB_ACCOUNT="your_account"

	### Prefect Deployment
	```markdown
	### Prefect Deployment

	The flow is deployed to Prefect Cloud, where it can be monitored, scheduled, and run.

	#### Deployment YAML

	The deployment configuration is located in `deployments/etl_data_pipeline.yaml`. This YAML file defines:
	- The flow to deploy (`etl_data_pipeline`)
	- Tags to help with organization in Prefect Cloud
	- An optional schedule for automated runs

	#### Applying the Deployment

	To apply the deployment (if using the CLI):

	```bash
	prefect deployment apply deployments/etl_data_pipeline.yaml

Or, create the deployment manually in Prefect Cloud.

	#### Local Run

	To test the pipeline locally, run:

	```bash
	python3 data_pipeline.py

Prefect Cloud Run
1.Go to your Prefect Cloud dashboard.
2.Locate the etl_data_pipeline flow.
3.Manually trigger a run or set up a schedule for automated runs.

	### Scheduling the Pipeline
	```markdown
	### Scheduling the Pipeline

	To automate the ETL pipeline, you can configure a schedule in Prefect Cloud.

	1. In the Prefect Cloud dashboard, navigate to **Deployments**.
	2. Select `etl_data_pipeline` and add a schedule (e.g., daily at 2 AM).

	Alternatively, define the schedule directly in the `etl_data_pipeline.yaml` file under the `schedule` field.


### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the pipeline include:

- **Dynamic Parameters**: Allow users to specify input parameters at runtime.
- **Error Handling and Retries**: Implement robust error handling and retries for data extraction and loading.
- **Integration with Other Data Sources**: Connect to various data sources, such as APIs, cloud storage, or data lakes.
- **Additional Transformations**: Expand the transformation logic to handle more complex data processing.
